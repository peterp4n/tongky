5. Whoops - https://github.com/filp/whoops

Whoops greatly improves the debugging experience in PHP by displaying a detailed error page when something breaks in an app. This error page gives us the full stack trace showing the specific files and snippets of code that caused the exception, all syntax-highlighted and colorful. The Laravel framework comes with Whoops built-in.


6. FastCache - https://github.com/PHPSocialNetwork/phpfastcache

Implementing this caching system in your PHP apps is guaranteed to make them load way quicker by reducing the amount of queries sent to the database. Instead of executing every DB query, FastCache sends only the unique ones, saves them as cache, and then serves them from there for each repetition. This way if you have the same query repeated 1000 times, it will be loaded from the DB one time, the rest 999 loads will be from cache.
 
7. Guzzle - https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle

Guzzle is one of the best HTTP clients out there.

Working with Guzzle is really easy and the docs are well written with lots of examples and detailed explanations.

The Ratchet library adds support for the WebSockets interface in apps with a PHP backend. WebSockets enable two-way communication between the server and client side in real time.
